# Continous-Space-Learning-Processing
This course gives an introduction to topics in human language technology, with a focus on continuous-space statistical models of language and their application to problems in natural language processing. Low rank distributional representations and several neural network sequence and sequence-to-sequence models are addressed. Problems associated with language processing include word-level tasks, language modeling, similarity scoring, text categorization, and select NLP applications.

This course comprises three coding homework assignments and three summaries of research papers in the NLP study field.
